Along the way, it began publishing Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), a searchable and downloadable database containing all of its domestic nomenclature. In Alaska alone, the database lists names for 167 dams, 303 post offices, 666 glaciers, 2,704 capes, and 9,575 streams. My favorite: Confusion Creek.

Why the discrepancy? “[W]hile schools are required by law to provide the graduation rates of Pell recipients to any applicants who ask, a loophole protects them from having to report the same figures to the government.” Oof.

2017.07.19,2,Dublin in detail.,"Last week, a team at NYU announced “the world’s densest urban aerial laser scanning (LiDAR) dataset” — a 1.4-billion-point description of Dublin’s city center. They write: ”At over 300 points per square meter, this is more than 30 times denser than typical LiDAR data and is an order of magnitude denser than any other aerial LiDAR dataset.” The researchers collected the topographical data during a series of criss-crossing flyovers on March 26, 2015. They’ve also published a short, illustrative video. Previously: LiDAR datasets (DIP 2016.05.25) and 3D models (DIP 2017.04.05) of cities and countries around the world.
